## 🧩 Description

The **3D Canvas** project is a Java application that allows users to interactively manipulate 3D geometric shapes (pyramid and octahedron). It offers transformations like translation, rotation, and scaling, as well as projection switching between orthographic and perspective views.

This project is perfect for exploring 3D graphics, computer vision, and user interaction in Java.
